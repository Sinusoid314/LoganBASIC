- Core Restructure:
    - Store global variables in a 'gloabl' hash map, in Runtime class, whose
      keys are the variables' identifiers.
    - Store structDefs in the global hash map in Runtime.
    - Store userFuncs in the global hash map in Runtime, leaving the main
      user function as a property of Runtime.
    - Store nativeFuncs in the global hash map in Runtime.
    - Give VM class its own instance of Compiler class.
    - Split scanTokens() method in Compiler class into multiple smaller methods.
- Add a help section for using the core source file library.
- Add debugger.
- Add ability to import source files
