- Core Restructure:
    - Modify global variables to store them in a 'gloabl' hash map in VM class.
    - Modify userFuncs and structDefs to be stored in the global hash map in VM.
    - Modify VM to own Compiler instance.
    - Modify consumeToken() method in Compiler to read in tokens from Scanner on-demand.
    - Modify LOAD_NATIVE_FUNC opcode to reference a native function by name.
    - Possibly modify VM code that deals with ending a running program (Return from main function,
      END statement, runtime error, through a CallbackContext instance).
- Add debugging hooks to VM.
- Add debugging interface.
- Add a help section for using the core source file library.
- Add ability to import source files
