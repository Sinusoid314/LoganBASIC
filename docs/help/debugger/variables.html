<h3>Variable Displays</h3>

<p>
The variables displays list the names and values of all the currently declared variables.
The locals display lists variables declared in the function that is currently selected in
the call stack display. The globals display lists variables declared in the top-level code
that are visible to the entire program:

<p>
Since function and structure definitions are stored in global variables, they are listed
in the globals display. Clicking on a function definition will highlight the first line of
code in that function:
</p>

Clicking on a structure definition, structure instance, or array will expand the item to
show its elements:
