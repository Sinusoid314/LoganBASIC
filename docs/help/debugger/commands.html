<h3>Debugger Commands</h3>

<p>
The debugger commands let you tell the debugger when and how to step through your
program. They are located at the top of the debugger pane:

<h4>Resume</h4>

<p>
Runs the program at regular speed without pausing, unless a breakpoint is encountered.
</p>

<h4>Pause</h4>

<p>
Pauses the program execution, highlights the next line of code to be run, and updates
the variable and call stack displays.
</p>

<h4>Step Into</h4>

<p>
Runs the highlighted line of code, updates the variable and call stack displays, and
highlights the next line of code to be run. If the highlighted line contains any function
calls, the debugger will pause at the beginning of each function call.
</p>

<h4>Step Over</h4>

<p>
Same as Step Into, except the debugger will run through every function call in the line
without pausing.
</p>

<h4>Step Out</h4>

<p>
Runs all the code from the currently highlighted line to the end of the current function,
pausing only after the function returns.
</p>

<h4>Skip</h4>

<p>
Skips over the currently highlighted line without running any of its code.
